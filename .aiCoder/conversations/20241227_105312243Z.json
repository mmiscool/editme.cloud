There is no place in the class where it is called to create a tab bar.\n\n2. `async isSubdirectory(parentDir, potentialSubDir)`: This method is defined but never called in the current implementation. It's meant to check if one directory is a subdirectory of another.\n\nIf further actions are to be taken regarding removing or utilizing these methods, please specify."
